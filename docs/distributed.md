# Distributed System Architecture

## Overview
The distributed system implementation follows the architecture described in the original paper, providing scalable, fault-tolerant processing of customer service requests across multiple channels.

## Components

### Queue Manager
- Handles task distribution using Redis
- Implements push/pop operations
- Monitors queue lengths and system health

### Worker
- Processes tasks independently
- Handles sentiment analysis and routing
- Scales horizontally across multiple instances

### Load Balancer
- Distributes tasks across available workers
- Implements health checking
- Uses round-robin strategy for task distribution

### API Layer
- FastAPI-based REST interface
- Handles task submission and monitoring
- Provides health check endpoints

## Deployment

### Using Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Manual Setup
1. Start Redis server
2. Start API server
3. Start worker processes

## Monitoring
- Health check endpoint: `/health`
- Worker status monitoring
- Queue length monitoring

## Scaling
- Horizontal scaling through worker replication
- Redis for efficient task distribution
- Docker for containerization
