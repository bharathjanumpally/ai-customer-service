## Component Details

### 1. Frontend Layer
- **Load Balancer**
  - Distributes incoming traffic
  - Ensures high availability
  - Manages SSL termination
  - Health checks on API nodes

- **API Nodes**
  - Handle incoming requests
  - Process authentication
  - Route requests to workers
  - Monitor system health

### 2. Processing Layer
- **Worker Nodes**
  - Execute core processing tasks
  - Scale horizontally based on demand
  - Process sentiment analysis requests
  - Handle routing decisions

- **Redis Cluster**
  - Manages distributed queues
  - Handles caching
  - Enables real-time communication
  - Maintains session state

### 3. AI Service Layer
- **Sentiment Analysis**
  - Processes customer messages
  - Implements NLP models
  - Provides sentiment scores
  - Handles multiple languages

- **Intelligent Router**
  - Implements routing logic
  - Manages load distribution
  - Optimizes response times
  - Tracks service metrics

## Performance Characteristics

### Scaling
